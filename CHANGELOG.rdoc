== 0.1.5
* Xpath query parser was not matching leading '//axis::node' correctly. The axis was being parsed as '/axis'.
* The <tt>parent</tt> axis was not being handled correctly for the root node.
* Xpath queries were returning node-sets that contained duplicate nodes.

== 0.1.4 - 2010.06.26
* Xpath searches with attribute values containing a <tt>/</tt>, like <tt>style[@type="text/css"]</tt>, broke the query parser.
* The Manipulate::insert_after and Manipulate::insert_before functions and Xpath positions were not returning the correct nodes when other available nodes matched <tt>==</tt>.

== 0.1.3 - 2010.06.20
* The Xpath function 's' will return an empty Rind::Node rather than +nil+.
* Processing instructions were not being treated as nodes.
* DocType nodes were lacking proper equality checks.
* The Traverse::next, Traverse::next_sibling, Traverse::prev and Traverse::prev_sibling functions were not returning the correct nodes when other available nodes matched <tt>==</tt>.
* Adding exact_index function to Rind::Nodes. (used in previous bug fix)

== 0.1.2 - 2010.06.17
* When parsing HTML, script and style tags will not break because of a "<" in their content.
* Tag names can now have numbers. Previously heading tags would not parse correctly.

== 0.1.1 - 2010.06.14
* Attributes without a value or with a value containing a space broke the parser.
* Text nodes with newlines were being cleared when they should not have been.

== 0.1.0 - 2010.06.12
* Initial release.
